#Shake Me Up Alarm Clock


Shake Me Up is an open source android alarm application designed to keep ringing
until a certain amount of shakes has been registered with the device. 
The shake function is designed to not register unless the phone has
recieved a high velocity shake thereby ensuring the user actually 
wakes up. This is a small clone of Android [Android Alarm Clock](https://github.com/SheldonNeilson/Android-Alarm-Clock) by 
 Sheldon Neilson and was written just for fun.
