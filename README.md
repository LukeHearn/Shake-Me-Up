#Shake Me Up Alarm Clock


Shake Me Up is an open source android alarm application designed to keep ringing
until a certain amount of shakes has been registered with the device. 
The shake function is designed to not register unless the phone has
recieved a high velocity shake thereby ensuring the user actually 
wakes up.
