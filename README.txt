Shake Me Up Alarm Clock

Shake Me Up is an open source android alarm application designed to keep ringing until a certain 
amount of shakes has been registered with the device. The shake function is designed to not register
unless the phone has recieved a high velocity shake thereby ensuring the user actually wakes up. This 
application uses the open source Android Alarm CLock (URL https://github.com/SheldonNeilson/Android-Alarm-Clock)
written by Sheldon Neilson for many of the base classes.
